# Marketing Agency Website

## This is the solution for the challenge from EdX bootcamp, Week 1, Day 4. My task was to refactor the code to meet the standards of web accessibility. I was motivated to first learn about accessibility to be able to find all the points of improvement in the code. As a result, the code is well-structured and readable as I added HTML semantic element to the index.html file, reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and included comments before each section of the page.
